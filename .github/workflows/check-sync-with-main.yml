          ::error::❌ Source branch '${SOURCE}' is NOT up to date with ${MAIN}.

          To enforce the thumb rule — **always update your source branch from main before creating a PR to STAGING or MAIN** — we’ve added a validation check.

          If a PR to **staging** doesn’t include the latest commits from **main**, it will now be **blocked** until the branch is updated.

          Please ensure you **pull the latest changes from main** before creating any PR to **STAGING** or **MAIN**.

          **How to resolve if the "Check source branch up-to-date with main for staging PRs" check fails:**

          1. Pull the latest changes from the **MAIN** branch into your source branch.
          2. Commit and push the updates.
          3. The PR check will automatically re-run, and once it passes, the merge to **STAGING** will be allowed.
